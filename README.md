# Project Description

Our website is a *fully responsive* portal to local living. New to town? Soon to be Moving? Miss the old city? Use **Live Like Locals** to keep track of of the local happenings and information in your favorite city!

We use a bit of city validation and a number of API _AJAX_ calls to pull and display data details of upcoming events, sports arenas in your area, the weather, and the latest national press news in a stylish and custom city theme.

# Expected Use

User need not log in to search for information about a city, they can immedialty start looking for a city.

If a user chooses to log in they will be able load their favorite cities, they will also be able to add to and remove from the list of their favorite cities.

User looking for more information on upcoming events can click on the events heading and see a larger, more detailed list of events in a second section of the site.
